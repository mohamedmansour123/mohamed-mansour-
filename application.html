<h2>1. Python</h2>
Probably one of the easiest languages out there to start with for beginners because of how user-friendly its syntax is, how widely it’s used and what a big community it has around it. It’s my favourite programming language, and I have a video about it with a neat breakdown into details.

Python is a high-level, object-oriented language and can be used for data mining and visualisation, machine learning, web applications, game development and honestly anything else you can think of — yes, it’s that versatile!

Some of the major organizations and companies that use Python are Google, Pinterest, Instagram, YouTube, DropBox, NASA.
<h2>2. Java</h2>
Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the world right now! It isn’t as beginner-friendly as Python, as it was designed to feel similar to C++ but simpler to use.

Java is also a high-level, object-oriented language. One of its main draws is that it’s very powerful and secure and so all of the banking application development happens in Java only. It’s perfect for someone looking to work in Android development, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, or game/desktop app development.

A lot of people, including my fellow blonde techie YouTuber Blondiebytes, recommend learning this language as your first programming language because it reveals a lot of things that are behind the scenes in other languages!

Major organizations that use Java are Airbnb, Uber, eBay, Pinterest, Groupon, Spotify, Pandora.
<h2>3. JavaScript</h2>
JavaScript is a client-side programming language, meaning that it works in the user’s browser – as opposed to interacting with a server. It’s a high-level, prototype-based object-oriented programming language. It’s mostly used for front-end development. Don’t confuse JavaScript with Java though – they’re very different! 

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web and in fact, you’re interacting with it right now by interacting with this page. And most likely on the website, you visited before. And the one you will go to next.

It is traditionally paired with HTML & CSS and is a front-end language used to create interactive websites, but thanks to recent technologies like Node.js, it is possible to use JavaScript as a backend language! Needless to say, JavaScript is very popular and is the language of choice for many, many developers.

Major organizations that use JavaScript are WordPress, Soundcloud, Khan Academy, Linkedin, Groupon, Yahoo and many others.
<h2>4. Ruby</h2>
Ruby is an object-oriented, high-level programming language. It’s also very beginner-friendly and you can start building things fairly quickly with the framework called Rails (this is where the expression Ruby on Rails comes from). It’s used for web app development, robotics, networking, system administration and security. It is great for simulations and is even used for those by NASA!

Some of the major organizations that use it are Github, Scribd, Groupon, NASA Langley Research Center, Motorola, Google (SketchUp). Basecamp, Amazon, Twitter and Groupon were all created using Ruby on Rails.

Ruby’s founder, Yukihiro Matsumoto, intended it to be “simple in appearance, but it is very complex inside, just like our human body.”

Funnily enough, this was the language that I’ve initially started with!
<h2>5. C</h2>
C may be older than you: it was released in 1972! So at the date of writing this, it’s 47 years old. It is probably one of the most widely-used languages in tech right now. 

It is a structure-oriented, middle-level programming language mostly used to develop low-level applications – meaning that it’s widely used for developing device drivers.

It’s pretty powerful and was the inspiration for many advanced programming languages, including C++, Java C#, JavaScript and Pearl.

It is used to develop systems applications that are integrated into operating systems such as Windows, UNIX and Linux, as well as embedded software. Systems Programming, Artificial Intelligence, Industrial Automation, Computer Graphics, Space Research, Image Processing and Game Programming.

Major organizations that use C are Microsoft, Apple, Oracle, Cisco, Raytheon.
